The past week we have been working to create the PCB and get it on order, as well as simulate the total system (both subsystems combined)
to validate the overall system performance. We are waiting for the PCB to come in from being fabricated and will begin testing the 
system in its hardware form for complete validation of the entire system and checking those against the FSRs.
